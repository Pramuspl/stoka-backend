# About project
This is a hobby project of a NestJS API for retrieving stock data.
It utilises 3 external APIs:
- Alpha Vantage
- Quandl
- GPW (Polish Stock Exchange)

Currently it's able to retrieve:
- the symbol of a traded instrument (stock, ETF, etc.) and the stock market where it's traded
- the End of Day price for a given symbol
